# LRNR QUIZ PAGE

LRNR is a quiz generation application that utilizes the **Claude AI API** to create customized quizzes based on user input. This project involves refactoring the existing application (built with jQuery and GO) into **Node.js** and **React** while maintaining all current functionality. The goal is to create a clean, maintainable codebase that future teams can easily contribute to.

## Business Case
RVâ€™s AI team has designed an application called **LRNR**, which uses the **Claude AI API** to generate customized quizzes based on user input. The original application was built using **jQuery** and **GO**, but leadership has requested a refactor into **Node.js** and **React** for better scalability and maintainability.

The primary goal of this project is to recreate the existing application with the same functionality while ensuring the codebase is well-documented and accessible for future contributors.
